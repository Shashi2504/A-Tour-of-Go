# Concurrency

Welcome to the **Concurrency** section! In this final part, you will explore how Go manages concurrent programming using **goroutines** and **channels**. Understanding concurrency is crucial for writing efficient and scalable applications in Go.

## What You'll Learn

- **Goroutines**: Learn how to use goroutines to run functions concurrently.
- **Channels**: Understand how to communicate between goroutines using channels.
- **Synchronization**: Explore synchronization techniques to manage access to shared resources.
- **Practical exercises** to reinforce your understanding of concurrency concepts.

## Key Concepts

1. **Goroutines**:
   - Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. You can create a goroutine by prefixing a function call with the `go` keyword.
   - Check out [`goroutines.go`](./goroutines.go) for a basic introduction to using goroutines.

2. **Channels**:
   - Channels are the primary way to communicate between goroutines. They allow you to send and receive values, facilitating safe data exchange.
   - Learn how to implement and use channels in [`channels.go`](./channels.go).

3. **Synchronization**:
   - When multiple goroutines access shared data, it's essential to synchronize access to avoid race conditions. Mutexes are commonly used for this purpose.
   - Explore synchronization techniques in [`sync_Mutex.go`](./sync_Mutex.go).

4. **Practical Applications**:
   - Implement a web crawler using goroutines and channels in [`web-crawlers.go`](./web-crawlers.go). This example illustrates how to manage concurrent operations effectively.
