# More Types

Welcome to the **More Types** section of the repository! In this part, you'll explore Go's diverse type system, with a special focus on composite types such as slices, maps, arrays, and pointers. These types are essential when you need to store, manage, and manipulate data in your Go programs.

## What You'll Learn

- How to work with **arrays**, **slices**, and understand their dynamic behavior.
- How to create and manipulate **maps**, which are key-value stores in Go.
- Understanding **pointers** and how they allow you to reference and modify values without copying data.
- A deeper dive into **function closures** and their application.

## Key Concepts

1. **Arrays**:
   - Arrays are a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. While arrays are less commonly used compared to slices, they help establish a foundation for understanding Go's data structures.
   - Learn more in [`arrays.go`](./arrays.go).

2. **Slices**:
   - Slices are a dynamic, flexible view into arrays and are the primary data structure for managing collections in Go. Slices have both length and capacity, and they automatically grow as needed.
   - Key examples are in [`slices.go`](./slices.go), [`slice_len_cap.go`](./slice_len_cap.go), and [`slice_append.go`](./slice_append.go).

3. **Maps**:
   - Maps are Go's built-in associative data type, used to store key-value pairs. They're incredibly efficient for lookup and are a fundamental part of Go's type system.
   - See how to use maps in [`maps.go`](./maps.go) and [`map-literals.go`](./map-literals.go).

4. **Pointers**:
   - Pointers allow you to reference memory addresses directly, enabling more efficient data manipulation by avoiding unnecessary copying.
   - Learn how to use pointers in [`pointer.go`](./pointer.go) and [`pointer_to_struct.go`](./pointer_to_struct.go).

5. **Function Closures**:
   - Closures are functions that capture variables from their surrounding scope. They're a powerful feature that helps create flexible and reusable code.
   - Check out how closures work in [`function_closures.go`](./function_closures.go).

6. **Tic-Tac-Toe Exercise**:
   - This exercise combines many of the concepts from this section into a fun and interactive game using slices and loops. See the code in [`tic-tac-toe.go`](./tic-tac-toe.go).
