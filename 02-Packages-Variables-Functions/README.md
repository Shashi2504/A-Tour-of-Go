# Packages, Variables, and Functions

Welcome to the **Packages, Variables, and Functions** section of the repository! This section will introduce you to the building blocks of Go programs. You'll learn how Go organizes code into packages, how to work with variables, and how to define and use functions effectively.

## What You'll Learn

- How Go uses packages for organizing code.
- Declaring and initializing variables in Go.
- The importance of functions and how to write them.
- Key concepts like named returns, constants, and type inference.

## Key Concepts

1. **Packages:**
   - Go programs are organized into **packages**, which are collections of related Go files.
   - Use the `import` keyword to bring in functionality from other packages.
   - Learn more in [`packages.go`](./packages.go) and [`imports.go`](./imports.go).

2. **Variables:**
   - Variables in Go are explicitly declared, but Go provides several convenient ways to do this.
   - Learn more about variable declarations in [`variables.go`](./variables.go), [`var_init.go`](./var_init.go), and [`short_var_dec.go`](./short_var_dec.go).

3. **Functions:**
   - Functions are essential to structuring Go programs. Youâ€™ll explore:
     - Basic function definitions.
     - Multiple return values ([`multi_resu.go`](./multi_resu.go)).
     - Named return values ([`named_return.go`](./named_return.go)).
     - Closures (introduced later).
   
4. **Type Inference:**
   - Go can automatically infer types based on the right-hand side of the variable declaration.
   - See examples in [`type_inference.go`](./type_inference.go).

5. **Constants and Zero Values:**
   - Constants are variables that cannot be modified after their declaration.
   - Go also provides zero values for uninitialized variables, covered in [`contants.go`](./contants.go) and [`zero_values.go`](./zero_values.go).
