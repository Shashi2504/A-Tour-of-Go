# Generics

Welcome to the **Generics** section! In this part, you'll learn how to use **Generics** in Go. Generics allow you to write more flexible and reusable code by defining functions, methods, and data structures that work with any type, while still maintaining the strong type safety Go is known for.

## What You'll Learn

- **Type Parameters**: Understand how to add type parameters to functions, methods, and types.
- **Generic Functions and Data Structures**: Learn how to write functions and structures that can work with multiple types.
- **Type Constraints**: Learn how to restrict type parameters to certain types.
- **Practical exercises** to implement generics in real-world scenarios.

| `generic_types.go`         | Introduction to defining and using generics in Go.                |
| `type_parameters.go`       | Learn how to add type parameters to your functions and types.     |

## Key Concepts

1. **Generic Types**:
   - In Go, you can define types that take one or more **type parameters**, allowing the type to work with various data types without repetition.
   - Check out [`generic_types.go`](./generic_types.go) to learn how to implement and use generic types.

2. **Type Parameters**:
   - Functions, methods, and types can accept **type parameters**, which allow you to define behavior without tying it to specific data types.
   - Go deeper with type parameters in [`type_parameters.go`](./type_parameters.go).

3. **Type Constraints**:
   - Type constraints are a way to limit the types that can be passed as arguments to a generic function or type. This ensures that only types that satisfy the constraint can be used.
   - Although this concept isn't explicitly covered in the files, understanding constraints will help you better manage your generics.

4. **Practical Applications**:
   - Learn how to create a generic **stack** or **queue** that can work with any type.
   - Practice generic functions by writing algorithms that sort or filter collections of any type.
