## ðŸš€ How to Run the Code

### 1. **Install Go:**
   - Follow the official [Go installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install Go on your machine.

### 2. **Run `hello.go`:**
   - Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the `01-Welcome` folder:
     ```bash
     cd 01-Getting-Started
     ```
   - Run the `hello.go` file:
     ```bash
     go run hello.go
     ```
   - You should see `Hello, World!` printed in your terminal. ðŸŽ‰

### 3. **Play with `sandbox.go`:**
   - The `sandbox.go` file is a sandbox where you can experiment with Go code.
   - Feel free to write your own code and test new ideas by running:
     ```bash
     go run sandbox.go
     ```
